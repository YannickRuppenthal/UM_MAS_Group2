# Taxis Strike Back – Analysis

## Content  

### Core questions  

- What problem is addressed?

Technologically advanced service platforms outcompete taxi drivers.

- Is it an important problem?

This is a reccuring problem over the ages.
New technology enters the arena: those we do not adapt perish.

- What approach has been taken to address this problem?

Give access to technological solutions to taxi-drivers.
Real-time data analytics and large-scale multi-agent optimization technology.

- What (main) results and insights have been achieved?

Demonstration that proposed theoretical solutions to increase taxi-driver performance work in practise.

### Information to be covered

Here stuff is covered I'd like to have included in the presentation besides the core questions.

## Critics

### Important Hints for Presenters and their Audience  

- Paper structured?

  Logical paper structure.
  Introduction, Literature, Implementation components, Experiment, Analysis, Conclusion.
  But no hypothesis, expectations, at what point does it get useful for a driver?
  

- Writing style? (clear and understandable)

  Writers frame a situation where big service platforms are positioned against taxi drivers and taxi-industry.
  Readers might not follow this idea, but not much effort on convincing.
  Why should we care? Is it not all the same?
  Some notes on this much further in paper, at the Fiel trial.
  But, what is so bad about working for Uber compared to working as a taxi-driver?
  
  It is written like a story.
  It makes it accessible to read.
  Can follow their history and their decisions chronologically.
  Details build up later, which is a pleasant method to get drawn in.
 
  
- Reasonable approach?  
  - Why?  
  
  Reasons for scalability are explained clearly.
  Perhaps '2 Related Literature' is not a good spot.
  
  - Why not
  
  They have implementated another guidance system while Uber already has one.
  This can only help the taxi-drivers when this service is maintained by another party.
  What is there to prevent this party becoming the next Uber?
  
  - Could it be improved?
  
  I think they are not critical enough about their own work.
  Scaling up with number of drivers as a next step is not enough.
  For beating a party as Uber much more is needed than offering technology to drivers.
  Finance should get a prominent position.
  Durability, maintainability.
  
  From the technologically angle they have achieved a lot.
  Perhaps they should have limited themselves more in the problem definition.
  
  
- Experiments conclusive, convincing, waterproof, complete, reproducible?

  Perhaps not reproducable to everywhere.
  Singapore seems to collect a lot of data and is willing to share.
  This situation is not typical.
  No words are spend to describe this unique situation, or views shared how to scale this up to rest of the world.
  Yet in footnote 1 they do seem to think of the rest of the world.

- Claims are connivingly addressed and backed with (theoretical, experimental) results?

  No, not always.
  I am not convinced that ridership dropped by 20% since arrival of Uber.
  No reference is given.
  I suspect even they consider this drop only for the taxi-drivers not associated with the big companies.
  As if there are no drivers working for these companies.
  Does not make sense.
  
  Conclusion: 'first-of-its-kind' taxi driver guidance system.
  Really 'first'? Is a big claim.
  The existing Uber system could have been described better allowing us to follow this claim.
  What about other cities?
  They use 'to the best of our knowledge'. I think that is weak after such a big claim.
   
  
- Assumptions are clearly identified, any implicit assumptions?  
  - Assumptions are reasonable? 

  In introduction demonstration results are claimed based on one of their own definitions.
  (Guidances followed more than 60%)
  Claiming success based on your own definitions is obscure.
  At least a prominent position is expected where this assumption is discussed.
  But no: only one line where this assumption is mentioned again.
  
  It is implicitly assumed that 361 drivers in their field trial is enough to draw conclusions.
  Not seeing any quantative analysis on this.
  
  Driver recruiting process is not described.
  Should we assume test population is accurate representation of taxi-driver population?
  Did they ask their friends? Did drivers come to them?
  
  - Realistic?
  
  I think 361 drivers is too small set to measure accurate cooperation effects in a city the size of Singapore.
  I am not going to do an anlysis on this.
  
  - Oversimplified to the original problem?
  
  Yes. Problem is about competition. And implicit problem behind this is 'making money'.
  While discussing Uber they understand the money part, 'price mechanism'.
  They boil the problem down to 'roaming time'. Are there more metrics?
  Where is the money? Could be worthwile to roam long when you can transport a rich desperate client.
  When you want to beat someone you have to get better.
  I am pretty sure 'roaming time' is one of the metrics used by Uber, but 'money' is all that counts.
  Where is the competition? Seems data is available also for Uber taxis.
  Besides getting better yourselves, there is the part of the performance of the competition.
  Writers do not do anything with it.
  
  
- Any novel applications?

  Writers state that big taxi companies do not use new techniques.
  Not clear if writers are using new techniques.
  Does not seem so.
  What did they add?

- Follow-up research recommendation?
  
  Plans to scale up with number of drivers.
  Well, I think they should worry about the money.


- Anything unclear to you?,
  - what did you miss
  
  Difficulty of the taxi-industry adopting already available new technology is discussed.
  Why should they adopt the system from the paper? No reasons are given.
  
  - Experiments with specific parameter settings,
  - Comparison to other approaches
  - Critical discussion by the authors
