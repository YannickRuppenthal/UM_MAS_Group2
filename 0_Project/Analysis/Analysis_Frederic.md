### Information to be covered

Here stuff is covered I'd like to have included in the presentation besides the core questions.

## Critics

### Important Hints for Presenters and their Audience  

- Is the paper well structured? Is the writing style clear and understandable?
- Is the approach proposed in the paper reasonable? Why, why not and how could it be improved?
- Are the described experiments conclusive, convincing, waterproof, complete, reproducible, etc.?
- Are all claims made by the authors throughout their paper (e.g., “we solve problem X“, “we
extend method Y and …”) backed up through theoretical and/or experimental results, that is, are
all claims convincingly addressed?
- Did the authors clearly identify the assumptions they made, or are there any implicit
assumptions not mentioned in the paper? Are these assumptions reasonable, are they realistic,
or do they oversimplify the original problem?
- What novel applications might arise from the paper?
- What follow-up research do you recommend?
- What remained unclear to you, what did you miss (e.g., experiments with specific parameter
settings, comparison to other approaches, critical discussion by the authors)?
