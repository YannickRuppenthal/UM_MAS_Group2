# Taxis Strike Back – Analysis

## Content  

### Core questions  

- What problem is addressed?
- Is it an important problem?  
- What approach has been taken to address this problem?
- What (main) results and insights have been achieved?  

### Information to be covered

Here stuff is covered I'd like to have included in the presentation besides the core questions.

## Critics

### Important Hints for Presenters and their Audience  

- Paper structured?

  Logical paper structure.
  Introduction, Literature, Implementation components, Experiment, Analysis, Conclusion.
  But no hypothesis, expectations, at what point does it get useful for a driver?
  

- Writing style? (clear and understandable)

  Writers frame a situation where big taxi companies are positioned against taxi drivers and taxi-industry.
  Readers might not follow this idea, but not much effort on convincing.
  Why should we care? Is it not all the same?
  
- Reasonable approach?  
  - Why?  
  
  Reasons for scalability are clearly explained.
  Perhaps '2 Related Literature' is not a good spot.
  
  - Why not
  
  They have implementated another guidance system while Uber already has one.
  This can only help the taxi-drivers when this service is maintained by another party.
  What is there to prevent this party becoming the next Uber?
  
  - Could it be improved?
- Experiments conclusive, convincing, waterproof, complete, reproducible?

  Perhaps not reproducable to everywhere.
  Singapore seems to collect a lot of data and is willing to share.
  This situation is not typical.
  No words are spend to describe this unique situation, or views shared how to scale this up to rest of the world.
  Yet in footnote 1 they do seem to think of the rest of the world.

- Claims are connivingly addressed and backed with (theoretical, experimental) results?

  No, not always.
  I am not convinced that ridership dropped by 20% since arrival of Uber.
  No reference is given.
  I suspect even they consider this drop only for the taxi-drivers not associated with the big companies.
  As if there are no drivers working for these companies.
  Does not make sense.
  
  
- Assumptions are clearly identified, any implicit assumptions?  
  - Assumptions are reasonable?  
  - Realistic?
  - Oversimplified to the original problem?
- Any novel applications?

  Writer state that big taxi companies do not use new techniques.
  Not clear if writers are using new techniques.
  Does not seem so.
  What did they add?

- Follow-up research recommendation?
- Anything unclear to you?,
  - what did you miss
  - Experiments with specific parameter settings,
  - Comparison to other approaches
  - Critical discussion by the authors
